# Contributing to trace

Thanks for your interest! This guide covers the conventions used across the
hawk-eco. The eco-wide standards (versioning, release tooling, repo layout)
are defined in <https://github.com/GrayCodeAI/hawk/blob/main/VERSIONING.md>.

## Quick start

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description
   ```
2. Make your changes in small, focused commits.
3. Run the full local check before pushing:
   ```bash
   make ci
   ```
4. Open a pull request. CI will re-run the same checks plus security
   scanning, race-detector tests, and (where applicable) integration tests.

## Toolchain requirements

- **Go 1.26.4 or newer** — `go.mod` declares `go 1.26.4`, so older
  toolchains will refuse to build the module. If you use
  [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), `mise install` picks up the pinned
  version from `mise.toml` automatically.

## Build & test

This repo uses the standardised hawk-eco Makefile targets. Run `make help`
for the full list. The most common targets:

| Target              | What it does                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `make build`        | Build the binary / verify the library compiles  |
| `make test`         | Run unit tests                                   |
| `make test-race`    | Run unit tests with the race detector            |
| `make cover`        | Generate a coverage report                       |
| `make lint`         | Run the linter (`golangci-lint` / `ruff`)        |
| `make fmt`          | Format source files                              |
| `make vet`          | Run `go vet` / `mypy`                            |
| `make security`     | Run `govulncheck` / `pip-audit`                  |
| `make ci`           | Run everything CI runs (the gate before pushing) |

## Commit message convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This
isn't cosmetic — release-please reads commit messages to bump the `VERSION`
file and generate the CHANGELOG, so getting them right matters.

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```

**Types:**

- `feat:` — a new feature (triggers a minor version bump)
- `fix:` — a bug fix (triggers a patch version bump)
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `refactor:` — code restructure with no behaviour change
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests
- `build:` — build system or dependencies
- `ci:` — CI configuration
- `chore:` — anything else (no release effect)
- `revert:` — reverts a previous commit

**Breaking changes:** add `!` after the type/scope or include `BREAKING
CHANGE:` in the footer. This triggers a major version bump.

Examples:

```
feat(client): add streaming retry with exponential backoff
fix: handle empty response body in chat handler
refactor!: rename ClientV1 to Client (BREAKING CHANGE)
```

## Pull request checklist

Before requesting review:

- [ ] `make ci` passes locally.
- [ ] New behaviour has tests; bug fixes have a regression test.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` entries are **not** edited manually — release-please
      generates them from your commit messages.
- [ ] The `VERSION` file is **not** edited manually — release-please bumps
      it on release.
- [ ] Public API changes have updated doc comments.
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or PII in code, comments, tests, or fixtures.

## Code review etiquette

- Reviewers focus on correctness, design, and tests; formatting is
  enforced by tooling, not humans.
- Authors respond to every comment (resolved, addressed, or politely
  declined with rationale) — no silent dismissals.
- Squash-merge by default; the PR title becomes the commit (so it must
  be a valid Conventional Commit message).
- One approving review from a CODEOWNERS-listed reviewer is required.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue using the bug-report template. Include the `trace`
version (`trace --version` for binaries, `trace.Version` for
libraries — see this repo's `VERSION` file), reproduction steps, expected
behaviour, and actual behaviour.

## Reporting security issues

**Do not open a public issue.** See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for
private reporting channels.
